# Click (2006)

## My Favorite Movie:

"Click" is a movie a workaholic architect, his name is Michael Newman, who stumbles upon a magical universal remote ðŸŽ®. You read it right! He can literally control the universe using his remove control that was given to him by a strange man. ðŸ˜Ž

**Key Points:**

- *Time Manipulation:* The remote lets Michael fast-forward through life, skipping the boring parts. But, surprise, surprise, it starts fast-forwarding on its own.

- *Life Lessons:* Michael soon realizes he's missing out on important family moments. The movie takes a turn, becoming this mix of comedy and heartfelt life lessons.

- *Feel-Good Vibes:* Despite the time-travel-ish stuff, it's really about appreciating the present and valuing family over work.

**My Favorite Part:** My Favorite part is where he learned that " it's just corn flakes." ðŸŒ½
